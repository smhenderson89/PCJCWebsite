    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="+1">We have all seen some dreadful slides of awarded
      plants and flowers - untidy backgrounds, careless under- or over
      - exposure, bad lighting, blurred images, and distracting elements,
      such as labels, pot rims and stakes with bright green ties. I
      cannot guarantee that after reading this you will always take
      perfect pictures of orchids, but I hope it will give some pointers
      that will help you take acceptable slides of the awarded orchids.
      I will attempt to stay within the parameters of shooting slides
      of orchid blooms at the time and place of orchid judging, using
      equipment that can readily be transported and easily set up at
      almost any judging site. Assuming readers have some knowledge
      of photographic jargon, I have made an effort to avoid unneccessarily
      technical language. I can report only what works for me and my
      equipment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">In 1980 the American Orchid Society published
      a booklet, <i>Handbook on Orchid Photography</i> by Grenville
      Seibels II, which covers very well all the things I have to say,
      and a lot more. This booklet is now out of print; however, I
      have used this source rather freely in putting these notes together.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Equipment needed for photographing awarded
      orchids is simple and straightforward: camera, film, lens, tripod,
      lights and background cloth.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">CAMERA</font></b><font size="+1">: The
      camera and lens should be the best you can possibly afford. Any
      of the major brand 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) cameras will
      give you excellent results. Some of the well-known names are:
      Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Pentax, and Olympus. Stick to the big
      names; they gained popularity by being good. And always remember
      that you get what you pay for.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">The camera bodies I have been using for many
      years are the Canon A-1, with a power winder. This model has
      been out of production for some years, but I was lucky enough
      to acquire three of them while they were still available. This
      may seem like "overkill", but the value of having a
      second camera on hand when the one you are using has some unexplainable
      affliction at 10 o'clock at night 40 miles from home is obvious.
      The use of a power winder and cable release facilitates the shooting
      of the required number of slides of an awarded plant, while maintaining
      focus.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">LENS</font></b><font size="+1">: For orchid
      photography it is absolutely necessary to have a lens that can
      be focused down to extreme closeups; in other words, a macro
      lens. There are ways around using a macro lens - bellows, reversing
      the lens, adding a close-up accessory lens; however, the no-hassle
      way to go is a first-rate lens that is designed for the job.
      (Also good in photographing the kids or the landscape.)</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Again, beware of incredible bargains. Macro
      lenses come in various focal lengths, usually 50mm or 100mm.
      My choice has been the Canon Macro FD 100mm <i>f</i>/4 which
      comes with extension tube FD50. With the extension tube, a subject-image
      ration of 1:1 (life size) can be achieved. The 100mm lens enables
      the camera to be set up farther away from the subject, which
      allows greater latitude in composing and lighting.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">TRIPOD</font></b><font size="+1">: Don't
      make your life more difficult by trying to use a little, spindly,
      wobbly, telescoping tripod. Find yourself a real hunk of a tripod
      constructed of heavy gauge aluminum with outer leg castings at
      least a full inch in diameter. Staying in critical focus throughout
      the shooting of the required number of slides is certainly made
      easier when the camera and subject are absolutely stationary.
      Standard operating procedures should be the use of a heavy tripod
      and a cable release, ALL OF THE TIME.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">LIGHTS</font></b><font size="+1">: Even
      with the inconvenience of carrying reflectors and stands, I prefer
      using incandescent lights rather than strobes (electric flash).
      Incandescents have two important advantages over strobes: exposures
      can be adjusted by normal metering methods, and lighting and
      shadow effects can be balanced by eye instead of by guessing.
      I use two simple floodlight reflectors with collapsible stands.
      Photoflood bulbs come in two color temperatures, 3200 degrees
      K (Kelvin) and 3400 degrees K - your choice will depend on the
      color balance of the film you are using. Most of the color emulsions
      are balanced for 3200 degrees K, but there are a few that require
      3400 degrees K. A note of caution: because of the fierce heat
      generated, all photoflood lights should be handled with extreme
      caution during and after use.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">BACKGROUNDS</font></b><font size="+1">:
      The background is second only to the flower itself. Award photographs
      are used for plant identification and comparison and publication
      and a busy background or one of a distracting color defeats the
      purpose of these slides. The backgrounds should be discreet,
      muted and unobtrusive and self-effacing. The simplest method
      is to use an artificial backdrop of flat material large enough
      to cover the entire field of view and positioned far enough behind
      the plant to be out of focus and free of shadows cast by the
      plant (4 or 5 feet is a good rule of thumb). For AOS award photography
      the orchid <i>MUST</i> dominate the picture. DO NOT use gaudy,
      dazzling or heavily patterned backgrounds. My preference is a
      piece of olive-drab (gray-green) cloth, 2 1/2 yards long by 60
      inches wide, which is light weight with a matte (dull) finish.
      Some photographers may prefer a muted brown or dove-gray material.
      When this cloth is tacked or taped to the wall approximately
      5 feet or so behind the subject, quite often you will find the
      background in the slide will appear almost black with perhaps
      a hint of color. This blackness may be controlled by the postion
      of the lights and the distance the subject is placed from the
      background.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Many photographers are familiar with the 'Pantone
      matching System of Printing Inks" (PMS) color system used
      by the printing industry. Most printers will have the same booklet
      of PMS colors. the color numbers I would suggest to be matched
      by the cloth would be</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1">PMS 385 or 378 - gray-green<br clear="ALL">PMS
        424 or 431 - dove-gray<br clear="ALL">PMS 464 or 471 - brown<br clear="ALL"></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1">Using black as a background occasionally presents
      problems because some dark flowers tend to get lost against the
      inky black. The exact shape of sepals or petals fades into the
      blackness and becomes difficult or impossible to define. The
      use of middle value colors as a background seems to resolve these
      situations. Accurate shape is very important because these slides
      are used for identification and to compare with other blooms
      during a judging session.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">FILM</font></b><font size="+1">: When using
      photoflood lights, the film must be balanced for tungsten light.
      Using standard daylight film under these lights will result in
      the slides having an orange, or orange-red tint. Conversely,
      using tungsten-balanced film outdoors produces a blue cast. Filters
      can more or less correct these color distortions, but they sharply
      reduce the ASA rating of the film.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">During the past few years many advances have
      been made in the quality of color film. Most veteran photographers
      will agree that Kodachrome 25 was the number one film of years
      ago; however, with the sale of Kodak's film processing operation
      along with today's advancements in the chemistry and physics
      of film manufacturing, other films have made great improvements.
      I use Ektachrome 64T (tungsten) film which is balanced for use
      with 3200 degree K lights. Fuji has a similar 64T film which
      uses 3400 degree K lights. Once you find an emulsion that satisfies
      you as to color fidelity and saturation, stick with it.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">POSING</font></b><font size="+1">: It is
      important to stress that the chief purpose of awards photography
      is to provide future judging teams with a graphic, explicit basis
      for comparisons. The AOS prefers its record slides to be typical
      "mug shots" - a straight-on, centered view. However,
      a <i>subtle</i> shift of camera postion so that the viewing angle
      is jst a few degrees off dead center will sometimes give the
      flowers a more dynamic, three-dimensional appearence. The flower
      should fill the frame but not to the very edge. In mounting the
      individual 35 mm frames, the processor necessarily must mask
      a tiny strip along the edges of each frame. So when composing,
      allow a little space all around to avoid any undesireable cropping
      by the slide mount.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Points to remember when posing the flower:
      get rid of all tags, wire supports, ties etc., that will appear
      in the frame of the picture. Use tape to pull unwanted flowers,
      stakes or leaves aside. These distractions can destroy the impact
      of an otherwise fine photograph.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">LIGHTING</font></b><font size="+1">: Position
      the lights at least 4 feet or more away from the flower. These
      lights are <b><i>HOT</i></b>! Don't return a fried or baked plant
      to the exhibitor! The second light should be a foot or so farther
      away from the subject to give a more three dimensional look to
      the flowers. Move the lights around and up and down until the
      shadow pattern defines the edges of overlapping petals and gives
      a bit of shadow under curled segments. White and pale pastel
      flowers present a special problem. Using the lights as close
      and in the same fashion as with the darker-colored flowers usually
      results in a white blob for a picture. Simply back the lights
      farther away and even aim them a bit to the side for these flowers.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">FOCUS</font></b><font size="+1">: Of course,
      this is critical. I look for a weak shadow or pattern on the
      flower and bring it into as clear focus as possible, checking
      it from time to time while shooting the required mnumber of shots.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">EXPOSURE</font></b><font size="+1">: I
      use aperature priority. In other words, I decide what aperature
      will give the depth of field the flower requires, or will throw
      the background out of focus, set to this <i>f</i>-stop and let
      the camera decide what speed to use. Most of my shots are taken
      between <i>f</i>5.6 and <i>f</i>16. This procedure, of course,
      will depend on what kind of camrea is being used.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">I realize that these notes certainly do not
      solve all the problems encountered by the awards photographers.
      However, these few suggestions can contribute to better quality
      of awards photographs far beyond their ease of implementation.
      Hopefully, they will also spark more interest in improvement
      of awards photography in general.</font></p></blockquote>
