- Event specific pages, such as https://www.paccentraljc.org/20240120/20240120.html - can be ignored for awards, since they don't follow a traditional award structure
- However, these can be useful for resolving conflicts/errors in the indivudal award folder. If the date of the award doesn't line up with the date of the event, then use the date of the event
- 2024 has a different logic for SourceURLs, it is YYYYMMDD/awardNumber.html
