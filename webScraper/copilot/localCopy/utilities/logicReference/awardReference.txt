Awards with points (FCC, AM, HCC) are tied to flower quality and usually have measurement data associated with them (NS, NSV, DSW, etc.).

Awards without points (JC, AQ, CBR, CHM, SC, ST…) typically do not require plant measurements.

Some non-point awards like AQ still involve multiple clones, but not individual flower measurements.

Display awards (SC, ST, etc.) are for exhibits, not plants — ignore measurement fields for these. Add key-value pair isDisplay set to true. Set Genus, Species, Clone, Cross to N/A if not found in the source html 

Botanical awards (CBR, CHM, CBM) involve descriptive data and sometimes photos, not measurements

Examples:
Award 2025318 - AQ is a display award, so no measurements are expected. Add key-value object isDisplay true to JSON. If type is not included in source HTML, set to N/A. Description is part of the source html, starting with 'Awarded for ...'"

Missing Photography - Check source HTML, Photographer should have the text format Photographer: Name Name.

Award 20255363 - ST stands for Silver Trophy, a display award. Put N/A for genus/species. Add key-value object isDisplay true to JSON

Award 20255364 - SC stands for Silver Certificate - in this case a display. If no information is recorded in html sournce, then set to N/A

Missing Description - Exmaple Award 20255261 - "Three flowers on two upright". Most times the description will come after the measurements information, included many wordes in a senctence.
