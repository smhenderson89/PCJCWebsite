    "description": "An island of display at the show entrance, plants grown by many members of the San Francisco Orchid \n\t Society, comprised of a wide variety of orchid genera; large, well-grown specimen size cymbidiums \n\t and dendrobiums were the focal point of the display, surrounded by paphiopedilums, phragmipediums, \n\t cattleyas, rossioglossums, and may other genera, against a backdrop of a pine tree, with white phalaenopsis\n\t placed throughout the display to draw the eye from point to point; a unicorn and a tall mushroom with a giant dragon fly showcased the theme of the show: \n\t Orchids of the Enchanted Forest."
